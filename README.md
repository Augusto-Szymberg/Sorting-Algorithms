# Sorting-Algorithms
On this repository I will upload the code for various sorting algorithms in python and a graphical way to visualize them. Additional info for each sorting algorithm can be found on each file.
# BubbleSort
The bubble sort algorithm is one of the most intuative and basic sorting algorithms there is. But it comes with its disadvantages, the time and resources it requries are vast. The main disadvantage is that its time complexity is quadratic. This means that the longer the array of data you want to sort through the slower and slower the algorithm is going to get.
