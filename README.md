# Sorting-Algorithms
On this repository I will upload the code for various sorting algorithms in python and a graphical way to visualize them. Additional info for each sorting algorithm can be found down below and on each file.
# BubbleSort
The Bubble Sort Algorithm is one of the most intuative and basic sorting algorithms there is. It works by going through the entire array and swaping form left to right two elements if they are out of order. With this method it goes bubbling up the garbage. But it comes with its disadvantages, the time and resources it requries are vast. The main disadvantage is that its time complexity is quadratic. This means that the longer the array of data you want to sort through the slower and slower the algorithm is going to get.
# InsertionSort
The Insertion Sort Algorithm is a very intuative and basic sorting algorithm there is. It works by seeing one input element per iteration, it finds the location for it with in the sorted list. This method can work very well when the data is already mostly sorted. But when the data is completly unsorted it works very slow, espessialy when the list is very long. This is because the time complexity is quadratic.
# SelectionSort
The Selection Sort Algorithm is very similar to the Insertion Sort Algorithm and is an alternative to it. It works by selecting the smallest element in an array and bringing it to the start of the array. But this algorithm sufferes the same flaw as the BubbleSort and SelectionSort algorithms, its time complexity is quadratic. This means that the longer the array the slower and slower that it gets.
# MergeSort
The Merge Sort Algorithm is a much better alternative for a sorting algorithm than any of the previous. It works by breaking the main array into sub-arrays and then sorting them and merging it all back together. Its time complexity is quasilinerar meaning in goes much faster when compared with previous for big arrays. Altough it has one flaw, it requires extra memory. 
# SelectionSort
The Selection Sort Algorithm and its variations are some of the most used used sorting algorithms. It is similiar to the Merge Sort Algorithm because it becuase of its divide and conquer algorithm. It works by spliting the main array into smaller sub-arrays by using a pivot element. Its time complexity is quasilinear.
